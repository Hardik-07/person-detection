# PERSON DETECTION 
The project is based on the deep learning technology. In the project he has implemented Object detection using the YOLO-v4 model which is pretrained on the COCO dataset. COCO dataset has classification for over 80 Different classes.

## Requirments

  - Clone the AlexeyAB/darknet repsoitry

  - Test Image 
  - Test video file
    
## Steps
    
  - Open ``yolo.ipynb`` in Jupyter notebook or Google colab
  - Upload the test video and image file in darnet/data folder for testing
  - execute all the cells consecutively to see the Results.
  - It will give an Result video in which the bounding boxes will be drawn around the different objects
